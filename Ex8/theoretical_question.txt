a. save the token locally (for example in a file or in SP)
Pro: Saves time and resources logging in. 
Con: Not secure, anyone who has access to the phone has permission to access server.

b. use this token only in this current app-launch, and re-request a token from the server each time the app launches again.
Pro: More resilient to changes in server's behavior such as token change.
Con: Either we connect the user even if not needed or we bother the user asking him if to do so.
Re-request costs resources.
